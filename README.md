#### module1 - Plant Biodiversity

Our aim is to learn how to quantify biodiversity with field observations, contrast
hypotheses and validating them with publically available datasets, and make predictions.

The datasets available at our reach include a list of all species from Jasper Ridge, vegetation map, and template of R markdown for biodiversity analyses. 

1) JR_observations-218315.csv

All iNaturalist observations in Jasper Ridge. This is a citizen science dataset of species observed in Jasper Ridge using the iNaturalist.org platform.  This includes a picture, geographic position, and tentative name given by citizen naturalists.

2) JR_herbarium.csv

All species registered in the herbarium from Jasper Ridge over the last decades.

3) Google Spreadsheet we generated
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KhbNickXnH1gBP5F5XuOygm3fSbEx61fA-oCS_aeb7A/edit?usp=sharing

Transects we constructed in Jasper Ridge. We can extract species coverage (proxy of abundance) of each species along the transect.

#### module2 - Ecophysiology

Our aim in module 2 is to learn about the leaf economic spectrum and theories of plant strategies and community asembly.

Several datasets available to analyze are

1) Our Google Spreadsheet with leaf traits and other traits
Leaf traits

Additional traits

2) the GBIF.org plant species observations from California
GBIF.org (23 April 2021) GBIF Occurrence Download  https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.v3evdw

3) The Pierce dataset from the original CSR mapping publication with several thousand plant species

4) The Estarague dataset of within Arabidopsis thaliana variation in leaf traits

#### module3 - Genetic adaptation to climate
